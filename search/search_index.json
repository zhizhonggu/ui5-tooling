A type orchestrates a set of tasks and defines the order in which they get applied during build phase. Furthermore, it takes care of formatting and validating the project-specific configuration. Also see UI5 Project: Configuration application \u00b6 Projects of type application are typically the main or root project. In a projects dependency tree, there should only be one project of type application . If multiple are found, those further away from the root are ignored. The source directory of an application (typically named webapp ) is mapped to the virtual root path / . An applications source directory may or may not contain a Component.js file. If it does, it must also contain a manifest.json file. If there is a Component.js file, an optimized Component-preload.js file will be generated during the build. library \u00b6 UI5 libraries are often referred to as reuse-, custom- or control libraries . They are a key component in sharing code across multiple projects in UI5. A project of type library must have a source directory (typically named src ). It may also feature a \"test\" directory. These directories are mapped to the virtual directories /resources for the sources and /test-resources for the test resources. These directories should contain a directory structure representing the namespace of the library (e.g. src/my/first/library ) to prevent name clashes between the resources of different libraries. theme-library \u00b6 UI5 theme libraries provide theming resources for the controls of one or multiple libraries. A project of type theme-library must have a source directory (typically named src ). It may also feature a \"test\" directory. These directories are mapped to the virtual directories /resources for the sources and /test-resources for the test resources. The source directory must contain a directory structure representing the namespaces of the libraries it provides theme resources for. For example, a theme library named my_custom_theme , providing resources for a library named my.library should have these resources in a directory path my/library/themes/my_custom_theme/ . module \u00b6 The module type is meant for usage with non-UI5 resources like third party libraries. Their path mapping can be configured freely. During a build, their resources are copied without modifications. Tasks \u00b6 Tasks are specific build steps to be executed during build phase. They are responsible for collecting resources which can be modified by a processor. A task configures one or more processors and supplies them with the collected resources. After the respective processor processed the resources, the task is able to continue with its workflow. Available tasks are listed here . Processors \u00b6 Processors work with provided resources. They contain the actual build step logic to apply specific modifications to supplied resources, or to make use of the resources' content to create new resources out of that. Processors can be implemented generically. The string replacer is an example for that. Since string replacement is a common build step, it can be useful in different contexts, e.g. code, version, date, and copyright replacement. A concrete replacement operation could be achieved by passing a custom configuration to the processor. This way, multiple tasks can make use of the same processor to achieve their build step.

[string] [default: \"info\"] Local vs. Global Installation \u00b6 In general, we recommend a global installation of the UI5 CLI ( npm install --global @ui5/cli ). However, it makes sense to add the UI5 CLI as a devDependency ( npm install --save-dev @ui5/cli ) for a project that is using ui5 commands in its build or test scripts or otherwise depends on the UI5 CLI for development workflows (like continuous integration). In case you have both, a local installation in one of your projects as well as a global installation, the UI5 CLI will always try to invoke the local installation. This is in part because npm scripts defined in your package.json will also always invoke the local installation. This behavior can be disabled by setting the environment variable UI5_CLI_NO_LOCAL . Example You have a project located at /my-application . The project has a devDependency to @ui5/cli and defines the start script \"ui5 serve\" .

However, it makes sense to add the UI5 CLI as a devDependency ( npm install --save-dev @ui5/cli ) for a project that is using ui5 commands in its build or test scripts or otherwise depends on the UI5 CLI for development workflows (like continuous integration). In case you have both, a local installation in one of your projects as well as a global installation, the UI5 CLI will always try to invoke the local installation. This is in part because npm scripts defined in your package.json will also always invoke the local installation. This behavior can be disabled by setting the environment variable UI5_CLI_NO_LOCAL . Example You have a project located at /my-application . The project has a devDependency to @ui5/cli and defines the start script \"ui5 serve\" .

It represents Specification Version 1.1 . A projects UI5 Tooling configuration is typically located in a YAML file named ui5.yaml , located in the root directory. Example \u00b6 specVersion : \"1.1\" type : application|library|theme-library|module metadata : name : some.project.name General Configuration \u00b6 A project must define a specification version ( specVersion ), to which its configuration is compatible to. Also see Specification Versions . In addition, a project must define a type . This can be either application , library , theme-library or module . The type defines the default path mappings and build tasks. See UI5 Builder: Types for details. specVersion : \"1.1\" type : library Metadata \u00b6 A project must have a name and might define a copyright string. In the UI5 Tooling, a project is typically identified by the configured name . It must be unique and should follow a namespace scheme like company.businessarea.project . A given copyright string will be used to fill placeholders like ${copyright} and @copyright@ in a projects source code. |- is a way to define a multi line string in YAML. For details, please check the YAML Specification . Inside the copyright string, you can use the placeholder ${currentYear} which will be replaced with the current year. metadata : name : my.cool.project copyright : |- My Cool Project * (c) Copyright 2009-${currentYear} My Company * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 - see LICENSE.txt. Resources \u00b6 Path Mapping \u00b6 Depending on the project type, the UI5 Tooling expects your projects source files to be in certain directories: Type: application Default directory for runtime and test files: webapp Type: library and theme-library Default directory for runtime files: src Default directory for test files: test Type: module By default the projects root directory will be used. If your projects sources are located in different directories, you need to configure a path mapping. As types might require unique project structures, this configuration can differ: Note that all configured paths must be POSIX and relative to the projects root directory. Path Mapping of Applications \u00b6 Available mappings: webapp (runtime path / ) resources : configuration : paths : webapp : my/path Path Mapping of Libraries \u00b6 Available mappings: src (runtime path /resources ) test (runtime path /test-resources ) resources : configuration : paths : src : path/to/sources test : path/to/tests Path Mapping of Modules \u00b6 Any virtual paths can be mapped to any physical path. However, it is recommended that modules include their namespace in the virtual path and use the /resources prefix (e.g. /resources/my/library/module-xy/ ). resources : configuration : paths : \"/resources/my/library/module-xy/\" : lib \"/resources/my/library/module-xy-min/\" : dist Encoding of *.properties files \u00b6 Available since UI5 CLI v1.7.0 By default, the UI5 Tooling expects *.properties files to be ISO-8859-1 encoded. If your project uses UTF-8 encoding for these files (for example because it has been created in SAP WebIDE), you need to set the propertiesFileSourceEncoding configuration property. Your projects *.properties files will be read in the given encoding and any non-ASCII characters replaced with the respective unicode escape sequences. This allows you to deploy the resulting files to any environment, independent from how it expects *.properties files to be encoded. Please refer to RFC 7 for details. resources : configuration : propertiesFileSourceEncoding : UTF-8 Build Configuration \u00b6 Build Resources \u00b6 You can exclude a projects resources from the build process using a list of glob patterns. Matching resources will be ignored by the builder and all build tasks. Patterns are applied to the virtual path of resources (i.e. the UI5 runtime paths). Exclude patterns are always applied after any includes. builder : resources : excludes : - \"/resources/some/project/name/test_results/**\" - \"/test-resources/**\" - \"!/test-resources/some/project/name/demo-app/**\" JSDoc \u00b6 You can exclude a projects resources from the JSDoc build process using a list of glob patterns. Matching resources will be ignored by the JSDoc build task. Patterns are always applied relative to the projects virtual source directory /resources/ . Any general builder excludes (as defined in builder.resources.excludes ) are applied after these excludes. builder : jsdoc : excludes : - \"some/project/name/thirdparty/**\" Cachebuster \u00b6 By default, the generated cachebuster info file signatures are based on timestamps ( time ). In setups like CI environments, a mechanism based on file hashes ( hash ) might be more reliable. See also PR #241 . builder : cachebuster : signatureType : hash Custom Tasks \u00b6 You can define custom build tasks that will be executed for the project. Please refer to the Custom Tasks Documentation for a detailed explanation and examples of the build extensibility. Each customTasks entry must define the name of the custom task as defined in its metadata.name property. In addition, the execution order needs to be defined by referencing a standard task or an already configured custom task using the afterTask or beforeTask property. Optionally, arbitrary configuration can be passed to the custom task. builder : customTasks : - name : custom-task-1 beforeTask : replaceCopyright configuration : some-key : some value - name : custom-task-2 afterTask : custom-task-1 configuration : color : blue Server Configuration \u00b6 By default, the UI5 Tooling will serve applications using port 8080 . When running in HTTP/2 or HTTPS mode, port 8443 will be used. If the default port is already in use, the next higher free port will be used. Instead of this behavior, a project can configure alternative default ports. If the configured port is already in use, an error will be thrown. The server port can still be overwritten with the CLI parameter --port . server : settings : httpPort : 1337 httpsPort : 1443 Extension Configuration \u00b6 Extensions configuration can be added to any projects ui5.yaml . It should to be located after the projects configuration, separated by three dashes \" --- \". In cases where an extension shall be reused across multiple projects you can make it a module itself and have its configuration in a standalone ui5.yaml located inside that module. Extensions can be identified by the kind: extension configuration. Note that if no kind configuration is given, project is assumed.

You may want to handle requests differently. For example add various headers to a response or parse data of a POST request in a specific way. For this you can plug custom middleware implementations into the internal express server of the UI5 Server module. Configuration \u00b6 In a projects ui5.yaml file, you can define additional server middleware modules that will be executed when the request is received by the server. This configuration exclusively affects the server started in this project. Custom middleware configurations defined in any dependencies are ignored.

Execution order \u00b6 The order of the middleware is important. Multiple middleware configurations are applied in the provided order. Custom Middleware Extension \u00b6 A custom middleware extension consists of a ui5.yaml and a custom middleware implementation . It can be a standalone module or part of an existing UI5 project.

Alternatively you can implement a custom middleware extension as part of your UI5 project . In that case, the configuration of the extension is part of your project configuration inside the ui5.yaml as shown below. The UI5 Server will detect the custom middleware configuration of the project and use the middleware on startup. Example: Custom Middleware Extension defined in UI5 project \u00b6 # Project configuration for the above example specVersion : \"1.1\" kind : project type : application metadata : name : my.application server : customMiddleware : - name : markdownHandler beforeMiddleware : serveResources --- # Custom middleware extension as part of your project specVersion : \"1.1\" kind : extension type : server-middleware metadata : name : markdownHandler middleware : path : lib/middleware/markdownHandler.js Custom Middleware Implementation \u00b6 A custom middleware implementation needs to return a function with the following signature: /** * Custom UI5 Server middleware example * * @param {Object} parameters Parameters * @param {Object} parameters.resources Resource collections * @param {module:@ui5/fs.AbstractReader} parameters.resources.all Reader or Collection to read resources of the * root project and its dependencies * @param {module:@ui5/fs.AbstractReader} parameters.resources.rootProject Reader or Collection to read resources of * the project the server is started in * @param {module:@ui5/fs.AbstractReader} parameters.resources.dependencies Reader or Collection to read resources of * the projects dependencies * @param {Object} parameters.options Options * @param {string} [parameters.options.configuration] Custom server middleware configuration if given in ui5.yaml * @returns {function} Middleware function to use */ module . exports = function ({ resources , options }) { return function ( req , res , next ) { // [...] } }; Example: lib/middleware/markdownHandler.js \u00b6 // Custom middleware implementation module . exports = function ({ resources , options }) { const MarkdownIt = require ( 'markdown-it' ); const md = new MarkdownIt (); return function ( req , res , next ) { if ( ! req . path . endsWith ( \".html\" )) { // Do not handle non-HTML requests next (); return ; } // Try to read a corresponding markdown file resources . rootProject . byPath ( req . path . replace ( \".html\" , \".md\" )). then ( async ( resource ) => { if ( ! resource ) { // No file found, hand over to next middleware next (); return ; } const markdown = await resource . getBuffer (); // Generate HTML from markdown string const html = md . render ( markdown . toString ()); res . type ( '.html' ); res . end ( html ); }). catch (( err ) => { next ( err ); }); } }; Live demo of the above example: https://github.com/SAP/openui5-sample-app/tree/demo-server-middleware-extensibility","title":"Custom Server Middleware"},{"location":"pages/extensibility/CustomServerMiddleware/#custom-ui5-server-middleware","text":"The UI5 Server Extensibility enables you to enhance the functionality of the UI5 Server.
